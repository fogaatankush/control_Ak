## Introduction

> Today's AI is not an actual AI.

 Ai refers to Artificial intelligence.

> Now, In today's era we have artificial automation not intelligence.

#### 1. Actual Intelligence
In laymen's terms, Intelligence is an innate ability to infer something out of nothing.

Intelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviours within an environment or context

#### 2. Definition

Now the definition of AI according to Wikipedia the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.

This is, first of all, also wrong, but for now let's assume it to be correct. Still, then we are all wrong about what we think we know of AI.

#### 3. We are wrong

Now, why do I say that. I say that because even if a system was able to or had the capability to perform all the tasks that human could and if you think that's impossible then let's assume it can do roughly 85% of it. Even then, that system couldn't be called INTELLIGENT. Now you would be thinking why that is, why do I say that. I say that because intelligence is not about arriving at the end result, but about the process of achieving that end result.

Let me explain with a comparison. In today's era, we have large language models. These models at the fundamental proclaim to have the ability to comprehend a particular language and in turn be able to it in use in a functional manner. On the hand, we have a human who also knows that language and let's assume that the model and the human have the same proficiency in the language. Now one could infer from this that the system is intelligent just like the human and that's what people do today. They think if the  model can do the same things as an intelligent human then in turn the models must also be intelligent and that is their fallacy of causality. A human is not considered intelligent just because of being able to use the language, but is due to the requirement on the human to achieve the feat.

***
## Conclusion

A human doesn't require the enormous amount of energy that the model need to just give one answer. The human doesn't need the humongous data set to learn the language. The human doesn't need every single permutation of the language before. The human could create or add on to that language with something that didn't exist before. And for foremost all, a human could replicate his understanding of that language and be able to teach it to others.

> These are the requirements. That's y today's large language models what we call AI are not Ai, not even in the proximity of it in light years.
